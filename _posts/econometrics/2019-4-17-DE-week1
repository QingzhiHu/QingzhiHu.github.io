### Tutorials 
#### Theory exercises

1. Write in lag in operator notation

$$Y_t=0.1Y_{t-1}+0.3Y_{t-3}+\epsilon_t$$

$$Y_t=0.1Y_{t-1}-0.3Y_{t-2}+\epsilon_t$$

$$Y_t=0.5Y_{t-2}+\epsilon_t$$

Show that $$\bigtriangleup^2 \neq 1-L^2$$

2. Show that for a covariance stationary process, the autocovariance function $$\gamma_j=\gamma_{-j}$$

p43

3. For the random walk process, what is E[Yt|Ytâˆ’1]? Is this different from E[Yt]

non-stationary

4. Suppose Yt follows a random walk process. Is the process $$X_t=\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}Y_t$$ covariance stationary?

Yes

5. Suppose $$Y_t=X_t+\eta_t$$ with $$\eta_T$$ a Guassian White Noise process and where $$X_t$$ a covariance stationary stochastic process with autocovariance function $$\gamma_j^{X}$$/
